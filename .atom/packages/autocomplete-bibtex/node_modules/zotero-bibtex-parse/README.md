zotero-bibtex-parse
=============
A JavaScript library that parses (Zotero-flavored) BibTeX. Forked from ORCID's
[bibtexParseJs](https://github.com/ORCID/bibtexParseJs).

This branch, `resilient`, represents a significant departure from ORCID's
version. Instead of parsing incrementally, this version attempts to identify the
edges of BibTeX entries so that if something goes wrong while parsing an entry,
it can simply move on to the next entry.

Testing has improved and now uses [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/1.3/introduction.html).
Please file an [issue](https://github.com/apcshields/zotero-bibtex-parse/issues)
if you find something I've missed.

## Using in Browser
The `resilient` branch has dropped support for in-browser use.

## Using in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
Install ```npm install git://github.com/apcshields/zotero-bibtex-parse.git#resilient```

```javascript
BibtexParser = require('zotero-bibtex-parse');

parser = new BibtexParser('@article{sample1,title={sample title}}');

sample = parser.parse()

console.log(sample);
```

**Returns** A parsed BibTeX file as a Javascript object:

```javascript
[ { entryType: 'article',
    citationKey: 'sample1',
    entryTags: { title: 'sample title' } } ]
```
