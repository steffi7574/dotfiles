Similarly, options can be passed to the TeX program via settings or via a `%!TEX option = ` directive.\n* Forward and inverse search with the above PDF previewers\n* Parse the tex log output and list errors and warnings in the \"LaTeXTools console.\" Jump to the line containing an error/warning by clicking on the error/warning message in the LaTeXTools Console.\n* Reference completion via a convenient select view (with fuzzy search); autotriggered by default upon typing `\\ref{`, or via a keybinding\n* Bibliography completion (from one or more `.bib` files), also via a select view; autotriggered by default upon typing `\\cite{` and friends, or via a keybinding. The way citations are displayed can be customized.\n* Wrap selection in `\\emph`, `\\textbf` and friends, or in arbitrary commands; wrap lines in arbitrary environment. (Check the keybindings).\n* Find the last environment opened with `\\begin{env}` and close it with the corresponding `\\end{env}`.\n* Matching `$` and smart quotes: typing `$` yields `$ $` with the cursor between the dollar signs; typing `'` or `\"` yields one or two backquotes and one or two quotes, with the cursor in the middle. Wrapping existing text in dollar signs or quotes is also supported\n* Full support for multi-file projects by adding  `%!TEX root = master.tex` at the top of each included file. This includes error/warning reporting, forward / inverse search, and reference / citation completion. (Note: program and option directives must be given in the master file.)\n* Virtually all LaTeXTools snippets.\n\n**Keybindings**: by default, these are essentially the same as in Sublime Text, except that the **build** command is bound to `C-alt-b`, where `C` is `ctrl` on Windows and `cmd` on OSX. All other commands are triggered via combinations that start with `C-l`. As in Sublime, the \"select line\" command is remapped to `C-l,C-l`.\n\nMissing functionality to be implemented, roughly in the order I plan to add it:\n\n* Fill helper (autocompletion of various commands, such as  `\\include`/`\\input`, `\\usepackage`, `\\includegraphics`, etc.)\n* Better documentation :)\n* Toggling functions on/off: e.g., temporarily stop jumping to the current line in the PDF file after compilation. (Actually I'm not sure about this; maybe the listener pattern used in Atom can serve as a good replacement.)\n* Compiling and viewing on Linux\n* Other functionality in the Sublime Text package\n\n\nThe package does **not** provide syntax highlighting. Rather, it is supposed to be used in conjunction with the `language-latex` package: this *must* be installed for snippets to work.\n\n*Warning*: you will see many package settings. For now, only a few are actually honored. You are better off leaving everything as per defaults, except possibly for the path to your tex distro and PDF previewer (if necessary).\n\nA final note: there are a couple of other nice LaTeX packages for Atom. Each implements a specific function: compiling / viewing,  reference completion, etc. However, the objective of this package is to eventually provide the *entire* functionality of the LaTeXTools plugin for Sublime Text.\n\nHelp is welcome!\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/msiniscalchi/atom-latextools/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/msiniscalchi/atom-latextools#readme","_id":"latextools@0.7.1","_shasum":"3d78689a14a7cfb5ab3c7a5c941e3f6fe42441b3","_resolved":"file:../d-116013-13175-1vkv0yg/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116013-13175-1vkv0yg/package.tgz"}
